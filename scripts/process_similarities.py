This script will be run once the database has been populated.
For each card in the database, it will work out the the cards that are most similar,
maybe the top ten, and store them as an ordered json list in the database.

This will be quite time consuming that's why it is being kept in a seperate script.
It will probably be a good idea to keep this functionality also in the model too.
